# FancyCounter


FancyCounter is a straightforward and engaging number counter application built with React and Vite, utilizing CSS for styling. It serves as a simple starter project with the following functionalities:

Increment and Decrement: Start the counter from 0 and increase the number with each click, up to a maximum of 5.
Limit and Reset: Once the counter reaches 5, it cannot increment further. To continue counting, the user must reset the counter.
Non-negative Numbers: The counter will not go below 0, ensuring that the displayed number remains non-negative.
This project showcases a clean and minimalistic design, making it an ideal example for beginners looking to understand basic state management and user interaction in React.
